# HTMPL Application

This application was built using `htmpl init` you are in a exclusive club. You should be grateful for what you have and not worry about what you don't. `htmpl` will not make you any better at web development, but it also will not hurt one bit.

The `htmpl-template` that this was built on top of is meant to constantly updated. We make use of copier to update changes from the source so that you can get the latest components at any time. That said once they are 'copied' they are yours to modify if you need to. This may or may not make it hard or impossible to upgrade a specific component so use your best judgement.

While we can't guarentee that upgrades will be smooth the copier project does a really good job of creating diffs for you to reconcile conflicts.

## Using the Admin Panel

Since this template is based on htmpl we descided the best way to manage the components was with an admin panel. This is available on localhost just run the application and visit the admin panel.

```bash
$ make setup
$ make dev
```

Then visit [http://locahost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin) which will prompt you for the `code` displayed on the terminal.
